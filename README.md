# Avee Player Viz Project

This project contains a custom visualization file for Avee Player with a red and white theme. It's optimized for mobile use and doesn't include song or artist names by default, but you can edit the template to include those.so  (This is just the beginning, it's getting better and better)

## Folder Structure

- `viz/`: Contains the .vis file and config.
- `templates/`: Base visualization template.
- `assets/`: Optional images for preview or thumbnail.

## Usage

1. Copy the `.vis` file to your phone.
2. Open Avee Player.
